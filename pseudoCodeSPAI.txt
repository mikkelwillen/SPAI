Pseudocode for the SPAI algorithm
M = sparsity matrix (set to diagonal, if no prior info is available)
epsilon = tolerance (give as input to function, so user can choose)
max_iter = constraint for the maximal number of iterations (give as input)
s = number of rho_j - the most profitable indices (set to 5) (could think of a smart weighting)


For every column m_k of M
(a) Find initial sparsity J-round of m_k
(b) Compute the row indices I-round of the corresponding nonzero entries of A(i, J-rond)
(c) Create Â = A(I-rond, J-rond) (all the rows not removed from the previous step)
(d) Do QR decomposition of Â
(e) Compute ĉ = Q^T ê_k
(f) Compute ^m_k = R^-1 ĉ(1 : n_2)
(g) set m_k(J-rond) = ^m_k
(h) compute residual

while residual > tolerance:
	(a) Set L-rond set of indices, where r(l) =/= 0 (can be restricted to some number of largest elements in r)
	(b) Set J-rond_tilde to all new column indices of A that appear in all L-rond rows, but is not in J-rond yet
	(c) For each j in J-rond_tilde compute:
		rho^2_j = ||r_new||^2 - (r^T A e_j)^2 / ||A e_j||^2
	(d) find the indices J_tilde corresponding to the smallest s elements of rho^2
	(e) Determine the new indices I-rond_tilde
	(f) set I = I U I_tilde, J = J U J_tilde and A' = A(I, J)
	(g) Update the QR decomposition with:
		A' (alg. 17)
	(h) Compute ĉ = Q^T ê_k
	(i) Compute ^m_k = R^-1 ĉ(1 : n_2)
	(j) set m_k(J-rond) = ^m_k
	(k) compute the new residual
		r = A' m_k - e_k
